# Projects

<PageDivider />

Let's say I have some side-projects. With the same enthusiasm that I start and share new ideas, I also maintain the projects that others are enjoying and use in *their* projects. Here is a list of those ideas that I have public.

Remember that I have a lot of private repositories with logic that I don't share, or the project simply isn't ready for the public yet.
