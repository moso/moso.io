# /uses

One of my favorite things to do is to check out other people's setups. It can be as arbitrary as finding the _right_ font, when in reality it's not the font that matters. It's what you write...

But to make this obsession worse, here's _my_ list.

## Work

- My work laptop is a **[Lenovo Z16](https://lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadz/lenovo-thinkpad-z16-gen-2-(16-inch-amd)/len101t0082)**. It's always hooked up to a **ThinkPad docking station**, so I can have two monitors plugged in.
- For work, I use a home-built **[KBD67 rev2](https://kbdfans.com/collections/pcb/products/kbd65-65-custom-mechanical-keyboard-pcb)** 65% keyboard in an "E-white" **[Tofu65](https://kbdfans.com/collections/case/products/in-stocktofu-65-aluminum-case?variant=31400162394251)** case, sporting a [custom layout](https://assets.codepen.io/257418/screenshot-1593358613.png) since I love the flat ANSI enter but still need my Nordic letters. It's housing **[Drop Invyr Holy Panda](https://drop.com/?origin=%2Fbuy%2Fdrop-invyr-holy-panda-mechanical-switches)** tactile switches with "arctic white" **[Glorious GPBT keycaps](https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/glorious-pbt-black-key-caps)** on top. It feels like a dream to type on, and the sound is just like it.
- Mouse is a **[Logitech MX Anywhere 3](https://logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-anywhere-3.910-005985.html)**. Perfect size for office use. It's also wireless so I don't have to juggle with 8 cables.
- For flawless audio, I'm using a pair of **[Sony WH1000XM4's](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/headband/p/wh1000xm4-b)**'s with some of the best noise cancelling on the market. As these are wireless, they're hooked up through the dock's built-in bluetooth.

## Desk(top)

- Desk is an **[IKEA Bekant](https://ikea.com/gb/en/p/bekant-left-hand-corner-table-top-black-stained-ash-veneer-00366278/)** corner table so I have room for two monitors.
- My wife was so nice to buy me a **[Secretlab Titan XL](https://secretlab.eu/collections/titan-xl-series)** chair. Before that I had an IKEA Marcus, but I kept getting a sore back and had to stretch multiple times a day just to keep it at bay. Now my back is very happy!

<p style="margin-bottom: -8px">PC is a home build:</p>

- Motherboard: **[Gigabyte B550 Aorus Pro V2](https://gigabyte.com/Motherboard/B550-AORUS-PRO-V2-rev-10)**, mainly because it's the same as a X570 but I figured I didn't need that many PCIe 4 lanes yet.
- CPU: **[AMD Ryzen 7 5800X](https://amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-7-5800x)** cooled by a **[Corsair H150i RGB PRO XT](https://www.corsair.com/eu/en/Categories/Products/Liquid-Cooling/iCUE-RGB-PRO-XT-Coolers/p/CW-9060045-WW)** AIO.
- RAM: **[64GB Mushkin Redline](https://poweredbymushkin.com/Home/index.php/products2/item/5-redline/1682-mrd4u320ejjp16gx2?ic=1)** @ 3200MHz. Not the fastest RAM, and I'll upgrade in the future. But they're fine at the moment.
- GPU: **[ASUS ROG Strix GeForce RTX 3070 OC White Edition](https://rog.asus.com/graphics-cards/graphics-cards/rog-strix/rog-strix-rtx3070-o8g-white-model)** with 8GB RAM.

- SSD: 500GB **[Samsung 960 EVO NVMe M.2](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/solid-state-drives/ssd-960-evo-m-2-500gb-mz-v6e500bw)** for everything else that needs speedy IO.
- HDD: 2TB **[Western Digital Purple](https://shop.westerndigital.com/en-ie/products/internal-drives/wd-purple-sata-hdd)** for recordings, and long-term storage.
- PSU: **[be quiet! Straight Power 11](https://bequiet.com/en/powersupply/straight-power-11/1247)** capable of juicing out 850 watts.
- Case: **[Lian Li O11 Dynamic Evo XL](https://lian-li.com/product/o11-dynamic-evo-xl/)**.
- Monitor 1: 27" **[ASUS TUF Gaming VG27AQL1A](https://asus.com/Displays-Desktops/Monitors/TUF-Gaming/TUF-Gaming-VG27AQL1A/)** capable of 170Hz and 1440p gaming!
- Monitor 2: 27" **[Acer Nitro VG271P](https://acer.com/ac/en/GB/content/model/UM.HV1EE.P04)**

## Peripherals

- Keyboard: Custom-built **[Polarity Worx BT65](https://www.polarityworks.com/btckp)** with the same [custom layout](https://assets.codepen.io/257418/screenshot-1593358613.png) as my work keyboard. It's sporting **[Akko Cream Blue Pro v3](https://akkogear.eu/products/v3-cream-blue-pro-switch-45pcs)**-switches. On top it has [GMK Nord](https://candykeys.com/group-buys/gmk-nord) double-shot PBT keycaps.
- Mouse: **[SteelSeries Rival 5](https://steelseries.com/gaming-mice/rival-5)**.
- Headphones: **[Logitech Pro X Wireless](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-audio/pro-x-wireless-headset.981-000956.html)** for supreme wireless sound.
- Controller **[Xbox One S Wireless](https://xbox.com/en-US/accessories/controllers/xbox-wireless-controller)**.
- Wireless audio transmitter: **[Creative BT-W3](https://us.creative.com/p/headphones-headsets/creative-bt-w3)** for crystal clear, wireless audio without delay.

## Stream

I have put a bit of energy into my stream. This part divided in hardware and software, since it takes two to tango.

#### Hardware

- Microphone: The juicy voice you're hearing is coming through a **[RÃ¸de Podcaster](https://rode.com/microphones/podcaster)**. It's attached to the **[PSA1 studio boom arm](https://rode.com/accessories/stands/psa1)** through the **[PSM1 shock mount](https://rode.com/accessories/psm1)**. Since this is "just" a USB microphone, it's just hooked straight into my PC. Not as cool as XLR, though. But it does its job.
- Deck: To manage different scenes, transitions, apps and/or services, I've invested in a **[Loupedeck Live](https://loupedeck.com/en/products/loupedeck-live)**. This makes transitions and different scenes easy to juggle instead of clicking around in OBS.
- Webcam: For a crystal clear image, I've invested in a **[Sony ZV-E10](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/aps-c/p/ilczve10l-b)**.
- Lights: I use 11 **[Nanoleaf Shapes Hexagons](https://nanoleaf.me/en-EU/products/nanoleaf-shapes)** for lighting. Not the most ideal, but since they can be configured in all kinds of colors and patterns, they're doing quite nicely. Background lighting is provided by **[Govee Glide Lively](https://us.govee.com/collections/wall-lights/products/govee-glide-lively-wall-lights)** ceiling lights, and a **[Govee RGBIC LED strip](https://us.govee.com/collections/indoor-strip-lights/products/rgbic-smart-led-strip-lights)**.

#### Software

- Streaming: For scenes, transitions, and all the cool stuff I use **[OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com)**. Some browser sources are from **[StreamElements](https://streamelements.com)**. Others are custom made.
- Microphone is put through **[Adobe Audition](https://adobe.com/products/audition.html)**. First of all for an omnipresent noise gate, so I don't have to set up different noise gates in different software. But Audition also contains the VST plugins that makes my voice sound so deep and wide. Current plugins counts: Dynamics (internal - noise gate is here), **[TDR Nova](https://tokyodawn.net/tdr-nova)** for dynamic crispiness, **[TDR Molotok](https://tokyodawn.net/tdr-molotok)** for dynamic range and compression, **[T-De-Esser](https://techivation.com/t-de-esser)** to cut off the worst esses, and a couple of internal amplifications to make it all on level again.
- All audio is filtered through virtual devices in **[VoiceMeeter Potato](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/potato.htm)** for ultimate control. This way I can control volume (and essentially everything else) before it comes into the stream. A good example is the microphone that passes through Adobe Audition, then into Potato, then into OBS as its own device. Discord has its own device so I can easily turn it on/off with a simple mute button and not juggle different default devices. Super smart but super complex!

## Misc & other software

- OS: I'm using Windows 11 Pro.
- Firewall: **[simplewall](https://henrypp.org/product/simplewall)**.
- Start Menu: **[Start10](https://stardock.com/products/start10/)** to get rid of the modern start menu, and (again) to get a more Windows 7-ish experience.
- Browser: **[Firefox](https://firefox.com)** with a hardened `about:config`, **[uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)**, **[Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/)**, **[HTTPS Everywhere](https://eff.org/https-everywhere)**, **[Decentraleyes](https://decentraleyes.org)**, and **[Momentum](https://momentumdash.com)**.
- Terminal: **[Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)**.
- Editor: **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)** with **[Catppuccin Mocha](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin)** color theme and **[Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono)**.
- SSH: **[SuperPuTTY](https://puttygen.com/superputty)** for superior SSH session management.
- Music: **[YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com)**.
- Screenshots: **[PicPick](https://picpick.app)** because it allows of saving the screenshot directly in a folder as .png, and I can get a unix timestamp in the filename.
- Custom cursor per game: **[YoloMouse](https://pandateemo.github.io/YoloMouse/)** with my own custom-made cursors.
- Password manager: Selfhosted **[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com)** because tinfoilhat.
- Cloud: Selfhosted **[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com)** because tinfoilhat.
- DNS: **[NextDNS](https://nextdns.io)** to filter out ads.
- Graphics: **[Adobe Creative Cloud](https://adobe.com/uk/creativecloud.html)** because I can't do things without Photoshop and Illustrator.
- Voice: **[Discord](https://discord.com)**, of course.

I hope you enjoyed this trip down my **/uses** lane. And if you have any questions, feel free to reach out and ask.
