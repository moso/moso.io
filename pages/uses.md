# /uses

One of my favorite things to do is to check out other people's setups. It can be as arbitrary as finding the _right_ font, when in reality it's not the font that matters. It's what you write...

But to make this obsession worse, here's _my_ list.

## Work

- My work laptop is a **[Lenovo T480](https://lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-t-series/ThinkPad-T480/p/22TP2TT4800)** equipped with 32GB RAM for all the VMs I have to run. Sadly it sports a U-model CPU, so it doesn't perform as good as I hoped. It's always hooked up to a **ThinkPad docking station**, so I can have my own monitors plugged in.
- For work, I use a home-built **[KBD67 rev2](https://kbdfans.com/collections/pcb/products/kbd65-65-custom-mechanical-keyboard-pcb)** 65% keyboard in an "E-white" **[Tofu65](https://kbdfans.com/collections/case/products/in-stocktofu-65-aluminum-case?variant=31400162394251)** case, sporting a [custom layout](https://assets.codepen.io/257418/screenshot-1593358613.png) since I love the flat ANSI enter but still need my Nordic letters. It's housing **[Drop Invyr Holy Panda](https://drop.com/?origin=%2Fbuy%2Fdrop-invyr-holy-panda-mechanical-switches)** tactile switches with "arctic white" **[Glorious GPBT keycaps](https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/glorious-pbt-black-key-caps)** on top. It feels like a dream to type on, and the sound is just like it.
- Mouse is a **[Logitech MX Anywhere 3](https://logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-anywhere-3.910-005985.html)**. Perfect size for office use. It's also wireless so I don't have to juggle with 8 cables.
- For flawless audio, I'm using a pair of **[Bose QuietComfort 35](https://bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-35-wireless-ii.html#v=qc35_ii_black)**'s with some of the best noise cancelling on the market. As these are wireless, they're hooked up through the dock's built-in bluetooth.

## Desk(top)

- Desk is an **[IKEA Bekant](https://ikea.com/gb/en/p/bekant-left-hand-corner-table-top-black-stained-ash-veneer-00366278/)** corner table so I have room for two monitors.
- My wife was so nice to buy me a **[Secretlab Titan XL](https://secretlab.eu/collections/titan-xl-series)** chair. Before that I had an IKEA Marcus, but I kept getting a sore back and had to stretch multiple times a day just to keep it at bay. Now my back is very happy!

<p style="margin-bottom: -8px">PC is a home build:</p>

- Motherboard: **[Gigabyte B550 Aorus Pro V2](https://gigabyte.com/Motherboard/B550-AORUS-PRO-V2-rev-10)**, mainly because it's the same as a X570 but I figured I didn't need that many PCIe 4 lanes yet.
- CPU: **[AMD Ryzen 7 5800X](https://amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-7-5800x)** cooled by a **[Corsair H150i RGB PRO XT](https://www.corsair.com/eu/en/Categories/Products/Liquid-Cooling/iCUE-RGB-PRO-XT-Coolers/p/CW-9060045-WW)** AIO with **[3x Noctua A12x25 PWM](https://noctua.at/en/nf-a12x25-pwm)** fans.
- RAM: **[32GB G.Skill Ripjaws V](https://gskill.com/products/1/165/184/Ripjaws-V)** @ 3200MHz. Not the fastest RAM, and I'll upgrade in the future. But they're fine at the moment.
- GPU: **[ASUS ROG Strix GeForce RTX 3070 OC White Edition](https://rog.asus.com/graphics-cards/graphics-cards/rog-strix/rog-strix-rtx3070-o8g-white-model)** with 8GB RAM.
- SSD: 250GB **[Samsung 960 EVO M.2](https://samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/solid-state-drives/ssd-960-evo-m-2-250gb-mz-v6e250bw)** for OS and most used games.
- SSD: 500GB **[Samsung 860 EVO](https://samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/ssd/product/consumer/860evo/)** for everything else that needs speedy IO.
- HDD: 2TB **[Western Digital Purple](https://shop.westerndigital.com/en-ie/products/internal-drives/wd-purple-sata-hdd)** for recordings, and long-term storage.
- PSU: **[be quiet! Straight Power 11](https://bequiet.com/en/powersupply/straight-power-11/1247)** capable of juicing out 850 watts.
- Case: **[Fractal Design Meshify 2 XL](https://fractal-design.com/products/cases/meshify/meshify-2-xl-dark-tempered-glass/black/)**.
- Monitor 1: 27" **[ASUS TUF Gaming VG27AQL1A](https://asus.com/Displays-Desktops/Monitors/TUF-Gaming/TUF-Gaming-VG27AQL1A/)** capable of 170Hz and 1440p gaming!
- Monitor 2: 27" **[Acer Nitro VG271P](https://acer.com/ac/en/GB/content/model/UM.HV1EE.P04)**

## Peripherals

- Keyboard: Custom-built **[XD68](https://kprepublic.com/products/xiudi-xd68-pcb-65-custom-mechanical-keyboard-support-tkg-tools-underglow-rgb-pcb-programmed-kle-lots-of-layouts)** with the same [custom layout](https://assets.codepen.io/257418/screenshot-1593358613.png) as my work keyboard. It's sporting **[Mill-Max](https://keeb.io/products/mill-max-hotswap-sockets)** hotswap sockets currently oppupied with **[KineticLabs Penguins](https://kineticlabs.store/switches/kinetic/penguins)**-switches. On top it has [Tai-Hao Deep Forest Blue](https://shop.tai-hao.com/products/pbt-backlit-c22gf301) double-shot PBT keycaps, but the **[GMK Nord](https://candykeys.com/group-buys/gmk-nord)** group-buy is going to be fullfilled soon(tm)!
- Mouse: **[SteelSeries Aerox 5 Wireless](https://steelseries.com/gaming-mice/aerox-5-wireless)**.
- Headphones: **[HyperX Cloud MIX](https://www.hyperxgaming.com/en/headsets/cloud-mix-wired-gaming-headset-with-bluetooth)** for supreme wireless sound.
- Controller **[Xbox One S Wireless](https://xbox.com/en-US/accessories/controllers/xbox-wireless-controller)**.
- Wireless audio transmitter: **[Creative BT-W3](https://us.creative.com/p/headphones-headsets/creative-bt-w3)** for crystal clear, wireless audio without delay.

## Stream

I have put a bit of energy into my stream. This part divided in hardware and software, since it takes two to tango.

#### Hardware

- Microphone: The juicy voice you're hearing is coming through a **[RÃ¸de Podcaster](https://rode.com/microphones/podcaster)**. It's attached to the **[PSA1 studio boom arm](https://rode.com/accessories/stands/psa1)** through the **[PSM1 shock mount](https://rode.com/accessories/psm1)**. Since this is "just" a USB microphone, it's just hooked straight into my PC. Not as cool as XLR, though. But it does its job.
- Deck: To manage different scenes, transitions, apps and/or services, I've invested in a **[Loupedeck Live](https://loupedeck.com/en/products/loupedeck-live)**. This makes transitions and different scenes easy to juggle instead of clicking around in OBS.
- Webcam: It took a while, but I finally got hold of a **[Logitech C922 Pro Stream](https://logitech.com/en-us/products/webcams/c922-pro-stream-webcam.960-001087.html)** capable of streaming my face in 1080p at 60fps. Not bad.
- Lights: I use 11 **[Nanoleaf Shapes Hexagons](https://nanoleaf.me/en-EU/products/nanoleaf-shapes)** for lighting. Not the most ideal, but since they can be configured in all kinds of colors and patterns, they're doing quite nicely. Background lighting is provided by **[Govee Glide Lively](https://us.govee.com/collections/wall-lights/products/govee-glide-lively-wall-lights)** ceiling lights, and a **[Govee RGBIC LED strip](https://us.govee.com/collections/indoor-strip-lights/products/rgbic-smart-led-strip-lights)**.

#### Software

- Streaming: For scenes, transitions, and all the cool stuff I use **[Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com)**. Some browser sources are from **[StreamElements](https://streamelements.com)**, as my dear friend **[Noxxi](https://greenrose-productions.com)** made some fantastic alerts that fit perfectly there. Others are custom made, as I work as a web developer and have a few integrations that work with various APIs including Twitch.
- Stream quality: I currently stream in 936p at 48fps. This seemed like the better median, since 720p gets distorted too much due to resizing, however Twitch's maximum bitrate of 6000 doesn't allow anyone to stream at 1080p at 60fps - there isn't enough headroom in the bitrate for that. Everything else is set to maximum through NVENC, which means my GPU will handle the streaming part. Perfect with this beast of a GPU.
- Microphone is put through **[Adobe Audition](https://adobe.com/products/audition.html)**. First of all for an omnipresent noise gate, so I don't have to set up different noise gates in different software. But Audition also contains the VST plugins that makes my voice sound so deep and wide. Current plugins counts: Dynamics (internal - noise gate is here), **[TDR VOS SlickEQ](https://tokyodawn.net/tdr-vos-slickeq)** (equalizer to cut off the unnecessary), **[TDR Nova](https://tokyodawn.net/tdr-nova)** for dynamic crispiness, and **[TDR Kotelnikov](https://tokyodawn.net/tdr-kotelnikov)** for dynamic range and compression.
- All audio is filtered through virtual devices in **[VoiceMeeter Potato](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/potato.htm)** for ultimate control. This way I can control volume (and essentially everything else) before it comes into the stream. A good example is the microphone that passes through Adobe Audition, then into Potato, then into OBS as its own device. Discord has its own device so I can easily turn it on/off with a simple mute button and not juggle different default devices. Super smart but super complex!

## Misc & other software

- OS: I'm using Windows 11 Pro.
- Firewall: **[simplewall](https://henrypp.org/product/simplewall)**.
- Start Menu: **[Start10](https://stardock.com/products/start10/)** to get rid of the modern start menu, and (again) to get a more Windows 7-ish experience.
- Browser: **[Firefox](https://firefox.com)** with a hardened `about:config`, **[uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)**, **[Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/)**, **[HTTPS Everywhere](https://eff.org/https-everywhere)**, **[Decentraleyes](https://decentraleyes.org)**, and **[Momentum](https://momentumdash.com)**.
- Terminal: **[Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)**.
- Editor: **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)** with **[Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme)** color theme and **[Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono)**.
- SSH: **[SuperPuTTY](https://puttygen.com/superputty)** for superior SSH session management.
- Music: **[Spotify](https://spotify.com)**, of course.
- Screenshots: **[PicPick](https://picpick.app)** because it allows of saving the screenshot directly in a folder as .png, and I can get a unix timestamp in the filename.
- Custom cursor per game: **[YoloMouse](https://pandateemo.github.io/YoloMouse/)** with my own custom-made cursors.
- Password manager: Selfhosted **[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com)** because tinfoilhat.
- Cloud: Selfhosted **[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com)** because tinfoilhat.
- DNS: **[Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com)** through a stub integrated with a **[Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net)** to filter out ads.
- Graphics: **[Adobe Creative Cloud](https://adobe.com/uk/creativecloud.html)** because I can't do things without Photoshop and Illustrator.
- Voice: **[Discord](https://discord.com)**, of course.

I hope you enjoyed this trip down my **/uses** lane. And if you have any questions, feel free to reach out and ask.
